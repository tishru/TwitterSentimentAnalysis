# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes sentiments in tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive, neutral, or negative. The tweets were preprocessed using techniques like cleaning, stemming, and tokenization, and features were extracted using the TF-IDF method. A Logistic Regression model was trained to classify the sentiment of tweets.

The model achieved an accuracy of **79.87%** on the training set and **77.67%** on the test set. This project demonstrates the application of natural language processing and machine learning for sentiment classification. Future enhancements may include using deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved performance.
